# Routify ~ Optimized Routine Generator
A Python-Django webapp that uses the Genetic Algorithm to generate optimized routines based on user constraints

The Program uses evolutionary algorithms, primarily Genetic Algorithm to generate best possible outcomes over a series of mutations across generations. The target is to generate efficient routines based on user's timings, priorities, compulsions and other notable data. Google Calendar integration and login system is also to be integrated

## How to use
At the time you are reading this, it is unfortunate that you cannot use it as Routify is currently under heavy development.
